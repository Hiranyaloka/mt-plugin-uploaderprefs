UploaderPrefs for Melody and Movable Type allows customization of the default options involved in uploading files and images.

# WHY

I don't like the default "Asset Upload" default options, which is to create a new entry, and to place the file in the root directory.

# USAGE

Set your preferences in the plugin settings.  Currently it supports two options, which can be set independently:

# "CREATE ENTRY WITH FILE" OPTION.
The plugin default is for the "Create new entry with file" option to be deselected. (Melody's default is for that checkbox to be selected).

# ASSET UPLOAD DIRECTORY
The MT default option is the site or archive root. UploaderPrefs default path is based on the date.

These options may also be over-ridden within the form dialogue.

# INSTALLATION
Drop the contents of the "plugins" directory into your application's (Melody or MT) plugin directory.

# TO DO
I'd like to add other options, such as a default directory.

UploaderPrefs for Melody and Movable Type allows customization of the default options involved in uploading files and images. Currently it only supports the "Create new entry with file" option.

# USAGE
Set the preferences in the plugin settings. The plugin default is for the "Create new entry with file" option to be deselected. (Melody's default is for that checkbox to be selected).


# INSTALLATION
Drop the contents of the "plugins" directory into your application's (Melody or MT) plugin directory.

# TO DO
I'd like to add other options, such as a default directory.
